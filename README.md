# This was a solution to a test below

## You are required to create a basic app which will allow authenticated users to query weather data from the following service (https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me//api/current).
  As a guideline, the app is expected to get the data from the service then store it in a database and then show the end user the results in android view. To get the weather         details a user will be required to enter the location's longitude and latitude and hit the search button to get the
  weather details.
  
### Your solution should be scalable and fault tolerant for example if the service is not available the user should still be able to get the results based on the last known values.
 * a) API Endpoint: https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me//api/current
 *  b) Example: https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me//api/current?lon=36.821945&lat=-1.292066
 *  c) Location details source: https://www.latlong.net/
 *  d) Note:
 *      i. Users will be required to login to access this portal
 *      ii. Users should be able to search for results even if the service is not available
 *      iii. Users should be able to reset his or her password
